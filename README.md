# SendEmailWithOffice365Exchange
Example C# project of sending email with Office 365 Exchange
I see this all the time- ASP.NET or C# or VB Devs trying to send email with their corporate mail server using Office 365 / Exchange.

This is a working example, with fields to help you test your settings until they work.

Enjoy!
